Moumita Paul,Very good laptoo at 24k price,5,"This is such a premium looking laptop at this price point. Extremely light weight, classy looking body and keyboard, ssd boot, pre-installed windows 10, fingerprint recognition along with new features from the updated os. Everything is beautiful in both form and function. I am very satisfied with it, the packaging and even the small and compact power cable. Can't believe something so good can be available at this price point. The boot time is significantly fast than other laptops, comparable with macbook. I am techy and very nitpicky about gadget features and specifications at a given price. So this laptop is awesome in every sense!I just received it today. Will update this post if i see in any issues in the coming months."
Kesav,Budget laptop,4,"Thin and light but delicate too. Bought it for 23K, so bit pricy. As Win10 has Windows Defender, no need for redundant Antivirus program. So uninstalled McAFee as it slows down entry level systems. Uninstalled Microsoft Office 365 trial copy and installed MS Office 2010. The system is working fine and smooth for daily works like Web browsing, MS Office etc.P.S It seems this model with Celeron 4020 is putup for sale since May '21, and hence old reviews here are for earlier model GQ329 with Celeron 3350 processor. The discontinued model was sold at around ‚Çπ 18 to 20K it seems."
Anoopsingh,Overall a good deal,5,"I am using this laptop for a week and feeling so much thankful to my choice of purchase as it is working accordingly my expectations .This laptop was manufactured in Apr 21 and have great features like fingerprints 256GB ssd which gives flawless speed and having fast charging capacity although it is not full HD but still not much difference in picture quality comparatively.The most favored thing in this laptop is that is of only 21350 INR by HDFC credit EMI transaction .As I bought it for study purpose, it is one of the best laptop in this price range."
Madhu R.,Lies of Amazon Prime Day sale. Fooling customers big time with Prime day sale.,1,"The MRP shown was around Rs. 45,000/-, as per Prime day offer the price will be around Rs. 34000/-. To avail this offer, I took the prime membership Rs. 129/-. After exchange, the price was Rs. Rs. 24,990/-. All seemed well till now. After receiving the laptop the price on the packet was Rs. 30,000/-So the whole Prime day sale, Prime Membership was all a big BS. The exchange is yet to take place.The product is good, but the Prime day sale, big discounts etc was making fool of the customers, nothing more."
Golden Bieber,Highly recommended laptop for those  whose budget is a quite low.,5,¬†I received this laptop üíª two days ago.I like anti-glare display and screen quality is above average.Celeron N4020 processor is not for gaming bcz in this price range please don't expect laptops for gaming.You have given 256GB SSD M.2 NVME in just 26990 RS it's enough.This laptop is only for programming and office work.Highly recommended those who are looking for best laptop under 30000.Build quality and look of this laptop is 4.99 out of 5.0 .One bad thing about this laptop üíª is that does not have a keyboard backlight.And I'll edit this review as I use this laptop.I hope this honest review will help many people üôè.
Ramdevhariarjun,Perfect laptop for moderate users,5,"Nice laptop. Writing this review after 1 week full usage.Pros:SSD laptop, so high speed performance.Booting time less than 15 seconds.Anti glare screen. So no eye strain after long online classes, particularly good for kids.Multi tasking working fine.No lagging found while surfing, attending online classes, working with acrobat, word, excel, powerpoint...Battery backup excellent, almost 6 hours nonstop usage....Cons:Camera quality average, but ok for online classes and meeting.Have to buy external hdd, since it has only 195 gb available space...Due to processor, high end gaming not possible.Verdict.Bought at 21k. If your budget around 20 to 25k and looking for online classes or for normal office works or office works, then definitely go for it.."
Vishal ..,I got in 23k,4,I Got this laptop in 23k and others are get this in 18 or 20k laptop this is not fare üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò£üò£üò£but laptop is Good
Ajit verma,Asus laptop don't buy,1,Don't buy this product... I am using this laptop in one day is very poor poor condition Asus laptop please don't.. and Amazon giving me a damaging product and is giving very very very damaging product so I returned it this product... please don't buy
Abhijit baidya,Just go for it !!,5,Read till the end.Reviewing after 12 days of usage.If your budget is around 27k and not purchasing for gaming then you should difinitely go for it. There are hardly any cons in this product.#Built quality is upto the mark.#Looks and feels premium like a 40k laptop#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.#Processing speed is fluent.#Camera is ok ok (enough).#Touchpad feels premium.#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.#Display quality is more than good in this budget.The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.So i would suggest everyone to go for it blindly and save some pennies without any disappointment cz i have been searching for laptop since 1 month and this fulfilled my all my requirements. Thank you
Sukanta N,Value For Money from ASUS,5,"It is a perfect value for money Laptop from ASUS. it is just for daily users not for gamer or edition person. I have purchased this for office work and my daughter online classes.It is really working fine. Batter life around 4-5 hrs off moderate use. Sound is good. Weight is balanced. It comes with Finger print sensor, which is fats and accurate.Don't worry about basic processor Like Intel celeron. SSD did all. Fast and smooth. U can shutdown and ON your laptop within 10 second. Restart time arround 7 second.Go for it to work moderate on daily basis.ASUS made it possible with the attractive purchase range."
Ravinder Kumar,Nice Product üéâüéâ,5,I was in doubt that is it will be support Tally & Busy Accounting Softwares.But after buy it all things are going good.Both Softwares are working without any issues.Nice Product üëçüëç
Amazon Customer,Please dont buy. Very bad Laptop,1,"Please dont buy.I have used for 1 month.Laptop hangs many times,Now not starting even though charging is full.Company cheating with customers..."
w.gomes,Great lappy for getting day to day work done.,5,"I was looking for a laptop that wasn't too expensive but had enough power to get office work, web browsing etc done. I feel glad I came accross the vivobook. It's quite good for what I had to pay in return and I would suggest anyone wanting to buy this to go for it."
Suhas Mudliar,Value for money.,5,"Best configuration at this Price ‚Çπ23k.Does the job, and does it well. Bought it for my daughter's online schooling. No issues so far.Superfast booting and shut down speed. Extra wide screen, well placed key board, biggest mousepad, separate number pad on right side, fingerprint sensor. What more you want! Integrated Graphics card is giving desired output with speed. All branded components, with no frills.Speakers are giving crystal clear sounds.Looks are good but Silver colour finish is little bit on whiter side. Looks like plastic. Very thin, and I think 'handle with card product.Overall happy with the buy."
Shubham Kumar,Great Laptop Under 30K,5,"I'm using this laptop since 4 months. My experience with it has been very satisfying. First of all, would like to say thanks to Amazon for fast delivery and good packaging. Coming to the laptop, it is a good laptop.The screen is good, clarity is nice despite HD only resolution. The speakers sound loud and with audio enhancement inbuilt, the sound is crisp. Ideal for watching movies. It is running Celeron processor which is meant for basic tasks but surprisingly coupled with 256GB SSD, normal tasks such as browsing, reading, document editing with Office feels smooth. But remember it isn't for gaming or heavy tasks. Battery life been great due to power efficient Celeron processor. Earlier I used Core i5 10th gen, although it was powerful but battery life wasn't that great. My usage is light with some browsing, content consumption and editing documents which this laptop serves without breaking a sweat. The fingerprint scanner is nice addition which I find very useful. No need to input pin everytime to unlock. Scanner response is pretty good. Front camera is okay if there's sufficient light in the room as you'd find in this budget. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
SAL,"Ok ok laptop , for light office application use only",4,"Features mentioned are incorrect for display and resolution. It is not FHD it is only HD . Given resolution is incorrect . There are conflicting info given in site.There is no Micro SD card reader available in this laptop.Read only product information section.Just with windows 10 running only with edge browser open cpu is 100 % in use and memory is at 70% use. So 4 gb ram is not enough.It is as good as chrome book . Functionality and its use is very limited .Boot time is very good around 25seconds.Good for browsing , short term video 30min max due to overheating issue.Ms team or zoom is ok but long hours being online may overheat the laptop. VGA webcam , so quality cannot be expected.Ms office apps are working fine , open only one at a time . CPU will run at max always 2.8ghz..no room to expand.Unable to upgrade to windows 11 , keeps telling to download and install but never happens. No error and nothing works. Windows 10 updated and works fine."
Mahesh Mahadev Dhulap,Genuine product,5,I like this
Prem maheshwarkar,The product is really really bad,1,"This laptop sucks. No doubt what did I expect after purchasing a ASUS. The laptop does remarkable job to representing the company name, quality and service. My laptop sporadically stops working for no good reason not even after a month I bought it. Not recommended if you want mental peace. Very dissappointed"
Ravi,Thik thak product he iss price me but thoda slow he .....,3,¬†Negative1.Fingerprints slow he kaafi2.Battery backup kam he3.video quality hd nahi lgta he.4.ssd storage he but slow boot hota he.Positive1.lockdown ke wajah se iss price me yani ke 25 k me laptop milna muskil tha . But mil gya2. Laptop ka look kaafi premium and slim he3. Students jo online class karta he uske liye thk he
ujjwal,You can do mid level programming it's supporting 4k video,5,"I was sceptical to buy Celeron processor but I bought this because it has M.2 ssd which means laptop SSD speed is high and it's turning on in 5 secs. It has 2.8ghz processor which is also enough if you're a everyday laptop user or even you can do low to mid level programming like Java, python they can run smoothly so go for it if you're looking for a laptop which is under 30k.Also, i played 4k videos on YouTube and it was running smoothly.If you a Bca or b tech student and you don't have high budget you can go for it will serve you enough.Cons :-Maximum RAM you can upgrade is 8 gb."

Rahul yadav,"Price should be below 24,990.",5,"¬†I talk to asus service centre they say price in amazon high price should be less than 24,000And laptop Look is slim , and easy to use or superb quality."
ambuj,OS crashed after restarting the first time,1,After opening the laptop and setting id‚Äôs and all and then restarting it OS crashed and I have to return the laptop.Nothing went well for me so I have to return this laptop
Rahul,Not up to Expectations!,3,"When I unboxed the product , My brain striked out like 'is this the Used one?' Laptop gets lag while using multiple applications.... This was not expected! It was not up to the mark which I was in..... Amazon please take of the products Which are highly at cost and offers!! Its my sincere request not to sell used laptops as Fresh one please..... Thankyou Team AMAZON"
Sunil,Suitable for online classes,5,"My kids Nursery classes started online this academic year and I though to purchase a basic laptop for him, and this one suitably serves the purpose for him. Please note incase applicable; The WebEx virtual background feature will not work on anything below the I3 range of processors, therefore it won't work on this one."
JS94,"It‚Äôs Wow, Quite a Piece!! Big Definite, Yes :)",5,"It got the Great looks for sure!!Feels light & easy to carryBattery charges quicklySSD is really fast here!!Display is just okCamera is averageGaming, can run wellVery Decent laptopFor basic operationsto students & teachersBuy it only if you get itfor a good good dealIn any trusted website."
Amirtha V.,Worst Customer service from the Asus Company,1,Ordered ASUS VIVO BOOK 15 laptop for the first time and it was defective as the battery didn't stay long and the total system is too slow...So proceeded for exchanges...For exchange progress it took more than 7 days where technical team visited only for the formality..They took the lap and exchanged with another laptop on the second one which doesn't have camera facilities üôÅ So again we switched to refund process..After they collect the lap from us they told we will receive the amount to the Original payment method within Sunday(I.e-17 april) Until now there is no progress from the company side. The total process took for a month...The laptop was delivered to us on March 17 and still the process is happening...Worst customer service by the company haven't seen such service in Amazon online shopping experience.
Sumanta Majumdar,Recommend Laptop under 23K for daily use.,4,"I had an urgent requirement for a regular use laptop for my sister and searched amazon to find this one.Really very good deal under 23k since you are getting 256ssd for this price along with upgradable memory which originally is 4gb out of the box.Overall quality is good with quality speakers and good enough screen even though it is not full HD. But overall specs are also par for the course considering the price and brand of ASUS.But dont expect gaming in this laptop since after all it a celeron processor.I was pleasantly surprised to see a fingerprint sensor which in today's world, laptops costing 3 times more than this dont even provide. So kudos to ASUS for that."
Amazon Customer,Awesome buy,5,"This product is very outstanding if you're looking for a pc for either home,school or college use. Even though product comes with intel celeron processor, it does the job with the help of ssd. Boot up time, battery, picture, fingerprint and sound quality are very good. Awesome design as well. You cannot do gaming. Expanding the ram and ssd would fasten the system. It is light weight and useful for general browsing, home and office works, watching movies etc."
sulal,Amazing Machine,5,1.Speed is good no lag. Same as an i3 processor2.Sound is very good3.Got it for 17k after exchange of my old lap4.Weight is also less at max 1.5kg5.Saperate ssd sata or hdd sata slot other than the inbuit ssd 256 which is a boon.Go for it without doubt....6. Screen is also good.
kuldeep yadav,Got Sratched Laptop,1,Everything is fine till now in laptop except one thing that I got new laptop with many scratch marks on top which will give the feeling that we are using second hand laptop instead of new.I don't think so we can expect this type of service from such a big company like Amazon.
Vikram M.,Decent for some moderate use.,5,"Bought this for my parents who mostly use it for checking emails, watching series online and some basic document editing and stuff. It's more than enough for that. Switches on and off quite in a jiffy and is large enough for old people to be comfortable with the screen and the keyboard too. Touchpad is good too."
Amit Sharma,Best in this range,5,"I really appreciate this kind of lappiReally never expected such a good speed from that 24000 rs. LaptopReallly it is worthyDisplay is also very good in this segmentDont compare this with i3Rather it is much good for browsing, normal working, movies, trading and yesInternet also supports 5gSo need of any lan cable or usb to lan adaptorHi speed wi fi already give us high speed.If yu have low budget definitely go for itOr if you have high budgetBut need a laptop for normal or average purposePlease dont waste yur money in 45000 rs. Laptop or i3 11 generation.Just go for it.I bet you blessed me"
asif khan,Very slow!,1,I had bought this only browsing but still it's not working
Hodor,It's a tablet spec laptop,3,If you just want to watch movies and browse limited tabs than this is for you. I bought it for my grandfather to watch Netflix only. Other than that it is slow and not reliable for work or student life. Please check the specs before you buy
Sanjay Negi Brice,Nice Laptop for the money,5,Nice laptop higher res compared to others in this price range which is nice. Very quick laptop loads up in a snap and the finger print reader actually works well.Very nice machine for the price - I am a happy customer :)
Sunita Kumari,Very nice product,5,Good for students and office purpose
Ayyappan,Value for Money,5,Good product for online calss purpose. SSD is very useful. Fast. Coming with Windows 10 OS. Camera is good. Keypads are projected from the base. Easy for kids to operate. Battery back up is perfect. Screen size is bit small. But ok at this cost. Need to install MS Office on our own cost.
Lembisana laishram,Not bad,1,"Screen is not smart, btw it's good for now"
Mayuranathan D,Technical issues,3,"Returned back and return processed First time had a problem with start as even after pressing power button it was not getting on immediately after 2 days of operation,Second time it happened after a week, It was subsequently corrected by the service engineer. After two days again it got stuck, none of the key was functioning thats why I decided to return since it is hardly 20 days from the purchase and there is some problem or the other frequently"
Sunil Kumar,Very good laptop,5,"Good product below 30k price range. Speed and look is very good, and display is okay.I bought windows 11 variant in 27k, however I feel windows 10 variant could have landed in 25k, but it was unavailable from a month."
Manoj P K,Value for Money Product,4,"After one week light usage, this is the feeling: Decent laptop for everyday use.Looks good, working smoothly ( browsing, document editing, music, movie, light gaming like 3D chess etc), fast booting, finger print scanner is a highlight, display is nice, good keypad- separate num keys (although missing num lock indication light), good touch pad, sound output quality is good, above average battery life depending upon the usage.Operating system is windows 11, updated properly & working smoothly.Thank you Asus & Amazon Team !!"
manish saxena,Great laptop in this price range,5,¬†Great product.. Sound quality is awesome. Best laptop in this price range for basic use. Haven't tried gaming yet but being a student this is the best option.
Varun chakri,Asus the fire,5,"A good one for a student for coding purpose using via python, c, c+. High speed finger print sensor. Worth of it. Only thing I felt is that a build quality should be improved for better experience and the charger should be some what a good one to be provided."

Razaul Mustafa Ansari,Does the job,4,"Using this from last 1 month, it works smoothly for basic office work or online meetings. It provided free upgrade to Windows 11 too. If you want a laptop for basic office work or for study purpose, this is ideal. Don't know about the gaming."
Amazon Customer,Affordable but not worth!!,1,The laptop is not worth. It is very slow in starting. You can't even complete the settings because it keeps on hanging. It starts making weird sounds anytime.
Mohammad Arif,Does the job,5,Actually I needed a budget laptop for my clinic to keep records and print prescriptions.Boot and shut down times are around 10 to 15 seconds only. Openning and closing apps is pretty fast. Doesn't hang or lag. All in all a good purchase. Go for it. You wouldn't regret.
Debanjan Sen,Excellent product,5,"This product is excellent for daily use. Tasks associated with MS office, reading PDFs and online classes are very well managed by this system. The SSD gives a better edge to the performance. There is a dual storage facility available. Overall the laptop is a winner in terms of performance ( only if one does not play games in it). Light weight and battery backup is a plus point along with the portability and silver colour looks awesome.A must go for academicians and professionals."
Mahendran m,It does the job,5,It's one those for online classes I have checked everything available online. At the end you can only choose this laptop for this budget. Before lockdown it looks like it was much cheaper few bought at 19k I bought this at 22k with offer.
Manish,Great Price for Upgrade,5,"I upgradade to asus from my old dell Laptop, I got a massive discount , and This Asus is value for money as it has a SSD not HDD or hybrid. Which usually last longer, And speed is one of the advantages too."
Snehal Thakor,.,2,"Looking at the memory card socket in the photo, but when I received the laptop, there is no memory card socket in it."
Mudassar Shaikh,Overall Good Product,4,"You get what you pay for, I bought it for kids online classes and till now it is working very well for thatDon't expect it to support high end apps"

The Ineffable,Beware!!! A Good Budget Laptop but...,4,"¬†Purchased this laptop at 25k, and using been using this for the last 10 months. Here is my brief review of the Laptop's performance.Design: In the budget segment, most laptop has an average plastic build, but this one is different. Build Quality is awesome for the price. Even after using it for 10 months, there is no deterioration. Laptop lid is still pretty much solid- no wobbling or looseness.Display: This laptop comes with a 15.6‚Äù HD display. Yes...it's an HD display which means it's not 1920x1080, the maximum resolution we can set is upto 1366x768. In this price segment we can easily find full HD laptops‚Ä¶so yes if you are into FHD display..you aren‚Äôt getting it in this laptop. Brightness is good for indoor usage.Keyboard: This laptop comes with Chiclet style full standard size keyboard. These chiclet keycaps are small and need time to get used to them. Overall ok..ok‚Ä¶no problem till now.Performance: As this is an entry-level laptop, it comes with an Intel Celeron processor which is built for a basic-light task only. I bought this laptop for office usage.. on which I am mostly using MS Office, Tally, and Chrome. With this kind of usage, we can even multitask. No issue at all, But if you are expecting some decent performance out of this laptop for, Gaming and animation tasks.. then this laptop can‚Äôt do that. Talking about the Entertainment, yes we can even enjoy 4K movies watching (watch the attached video for 4K Test), and as the in-built speakers are actually better than my expectation, you can watch movies with friends and family.Now let me quickly share some Pros & Cons:PROS1. Superb Build Quality2. Looks premium in budget3. Great Price-performance ratio4. Lightweight (1.6kg)5. Smooth 4k video playback6. 2-3 hours battery backup7. Fingerprint sensorCONS1. HD Screen (1366x768)2. No LAN port3. Poor Webcam (watch attached video)4. Nonsense Upgrade optionsI will update the review if find anything worth sharing."
Infinity,Crap product - Beware of the seller,1,"Extremely slow performing system, low quality screen and the whole experience of getting the system run is messed up. The product neither accepts a return, nor a replacement to a higher model, nor a replacement for the same model. Amazon's 7-day replacement policy is a scam supporting such irresponsible and cheating sellers. Would never recommend this purchase to anyone. Beware of the seller and erroneous replacement plocity statements on the site. Highly disappointing experience."
Sahil,Awesome laptop: After around 1.5 years of use,5,"I had bought it around 22,500 rs, as far as I remember. After using 1.5 years and doing every type of technical and analytical work on this PC, I can see this has been an amazing laptop. I wanted to buy one more for my bro but the price has increased a lot."
Sulil Madhok,Avoid this to save your money,1,Dies within 2 weeks.. pure garbage. Kindly refrain from buying from this seller. Kindly avoid this at all cost you will regret it.
